# Contributing

Feel free to contribute in any way you like, and if you feel comfortable doing so, follow our standard instructions below and learn how to do it.

## Project structure

- **api** contains all the external requests to our application
- **assets** contains the system's multi-language files
- **components** contains the generic components used inside the application
- **constants** contains the constant values and settings
- **design-system** contains the files that standardize the design system used in the app, from breakpoints to the color system
- **elements** contains the atomic components used within the generic components
- **hooks** contains generic React hooks
- **pages** contains page components for next.js
- **utils** contains generic utility functions used in the application
- **Views** contains the view building blocks for each page.

## Issue reports

A bug usually happens when something doesn't work as expected, and it can be caused by some code in the repository. Reports are important to help us overcome them.

Below are instructions on how to optimally report a bug:

#### In the Application

- **Feedback Button**: in the header, there is a button on the left side of application logo (on mobile, open the menu on the right, and in the last position is the "Feedback" button). Fill out the _Google Forms_ form and report what happened.

#### In the Repository

- **Try to reproduce the bug in the main branch**: The bug may have already been passed in the latest version, always check before reporting the issue.
- **Check to see if the issue hasn't already been reported**: It could be that your issue has already been reported by someone else, make sure it is not on the list.
- **Open a git issue**: Explain what happened, and give as much detail as possible so we can try to reproduce the same situation.

_A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more._

## Tests

To run the tests run the command below:

```bash
  yarn test
```

## Commit

To commit, you must:

- Certify if your code is valid to linters;
- Use commit rules in [Gitmoji Commitlint](https://github.com/arvinxx/gitmoji-commit-workflow/tree/master/packages/commitlint-config#readme):
  - Starting with one of these emojis ([Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev));

_Don't forget to setup your IDE with `eslint` and `prettier`._
